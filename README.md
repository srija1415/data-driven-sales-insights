📊 Sales & Customer Performance Analysis
📌 Project Overview

This project is an end-to-end Data Analyst portfolio project that analyzes sales and customer performance using real-world retail data.
It covers the complete data analysis lifecycle — data cleaning, analysis, visualization, and business insights — similar to what data analysts do in real companies.

The goal is to identify sales trends, profitability issues, customer behavior, and key business opportunities.

Analyze overall sales and profit performance

Identify top-performing and loss-making products

Understand customer contribution to revenue

Study the impact of discounts on profit

Generate actionable business insights using data
